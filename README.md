# Vehicle Detecting Method Based on Gaussian Mixture Models and Blob Analysis

Vehicle detection process provides relevant information about traffic patterns, crash occurrences and traffic peak times in roadways. This paper presents a vehicle detection method in a video sequence using foreground detector based on a Gaussian Mixture Model and Blob Analysis. The proposed method is composed of four major steps: foreground segmentation, blob detection, blob analysis and blob tracking. An implementation of proposed technique has been performed using MATLAB R2017a. The experimental results show that the proposed method can provide useful information for intelligent transportation systems.
